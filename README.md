By Rex and Villager Boy. A set of tools for PocketMine based on MySQL and PHP. Ban and unban people, setup PurePerms groups,
all from a simple website.

# Instructions
All you need to do is upload the website to a free hosting like InfinityFree, change the database name details in "config.php",
save, and the website should be working. Next, add the WebBans phar file to your plugins folder, restart your server, go to db.yml,
replace the placeholder details with your server details, and restart the server. Now, you can go to the website, setup the databases,
and use it. You'll need your database password to login.
